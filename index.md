# Welcome to Ecological Modeling (BI382) at Colby College

Ecological Modelling is a course that helps students learn methods in mathematical, computational, and statistical ecology. Collectively, these types quantitative models are central to ecological science for understanding, predicting, and inferring natural ecological phenomena. Mathematical aspects will cover traditional theory of simple, analytical tractable models. Computational aspects will cover the use and implementation of more sophisticated models, including learning numerical methods and analysis of complex data. Statistical aspects will include inverse and forward modeling to respectively evaluate a priori models and to make predictions with varying degrees of certainty.
