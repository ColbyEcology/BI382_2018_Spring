# Exercises and notes from Vandermeer and Goldberg
## For the draft due 16 Feb., Exercises 1.1–1.8
Notes and amendments:

### 1.1
By hand, compute the expected number of individuals over time in a population with a single initial individual that grows according to equation 3 for $\lambda = 1.9$, $\lambda = 2.0$, and $\lambda = 2.1$, where $\lambda$ is the finite rate of increase. Enter your data in R using `c()` for 10 timesteps. For example: `lambda_1.9 <- c(1, 1.9)` (but with nine more entries). Plot the data as points and use the function `points()` to present all three trajectories on a single plot. Plot your data as a timeseries, meaning the horizontal axis is time (or timesteps, in this instance).

### 1.2
Plot the numbers aclculated in exercise 1.1 as ln($N$) versus time. Do this by creating a new object that is the natural log of the data from exercise 1.1. Plot all three growth curves again using the function `points()`. Calculate and report the equations of the three curves (lines are technically a type of curve, should that be what your data show). To write out math inline, just put dollar signs around your text: `$\lambda$` (looks like $\lambda$. To write a block, put two dollar signs around text: `$$1 + 1 = 2$$` (looks like $$ 1 + 1 = 2$$).

Plot the numbers aclculated in exercise 1.1 as ln($N$) versus time. Sketch (by hand, by eye) the function that best approximates one of the data sets (try for $\lambda = 2$), and visually estimate what the parameters of that function might be. What is the nature of the function, and how do its parameters relate to the original construction of the set of numbers in exercise 1.1?
