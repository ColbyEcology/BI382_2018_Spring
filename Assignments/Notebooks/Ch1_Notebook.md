# Exercises and notes from Vandermeer and Goldberg
## For the draft due 16 Feb., Exercises 1.1–1.8
Notes and amendments:

* For exercise 1.1., calculate by hand, and add enter data in R using `c()` for 10 timesteps. For example: `lam_1.9 <- c(1, 1.9)` (but with nine more entries). Plot the data as points and use the function `points()` to present all three trajectories on a single plot.
* For exercise 1.2., create a new object that is the natural log of the data from exercise 1.1. Plot all three again using the function `points()`. Calculate and report the equations of the three curves (lines are technically a type of curve, should that be what your data show).


## For the full notebook due 23 Feb, all exercises (1.1–1.18)
